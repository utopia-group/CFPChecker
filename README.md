# CFPChecker: A Tool for Verifying Correct Usage of Context-Free API Protocols.

This is the tool proposed in the following POPL'21 paper:

[Verifying Correct Usage of Context-Free API Protocols](http://kferles.github.io/docs/publications/POPL-21.pdf)

This repository only contains the verification component described in
the above publication. The program slicing component is implemented as
a separate tool. We are planning to release this tool as well soon, if
you need access to this tool in the meantime please contact me
